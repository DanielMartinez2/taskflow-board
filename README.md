# TaskFlow Board

TaskFlow Board is a simple Kanban-style task management app built with React.  
It allows users to create tasks, organize them into columns (**To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**), move tasks between columns (via buttons or drag-and-drop), search by title and persist data in the browser.

This project was created as part of my portfolio to demonstrate front-end skills with React, state management, drag-and-drop and a clean UI.
